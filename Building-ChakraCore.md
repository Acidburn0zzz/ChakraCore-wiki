You can build ChakraCore with either Visual Studio 2013 or 2015, as long as C++ support is installed [*](#build_for_arm).

To build ChakraCore:
* Open ```Build\Chakra.Core.sln``` in Visual Studio.
* Select the target [Platform](#platform) and [Configuration](#configuration) and build the solution.
* Build output will be under ```Build\VcBuild\bin```.

Alternatively, run msbuild on the command line:
```
msbuild /m /p:Platform=... /p:Configuration=... Build\Chakra.Core.sln
```

### Platform ###

ChakraCore can be built for 3 Platforms: ```x86```, ```x64``` and ```arm```.

<a id="build_for_arm">**Build for arm**:</a> Due to toolset dependency, you will need following to build for the ```arm``` platform:
* Visual Studio 2015
* [Windows 10 SDK](https://dev.windows.com/en-US/downloads/windows-10-sdk)

### Configuration ###

ChakraCore supports 3 configurations:
* ```Debug```: Not optimized, with full runtime checks and all test hooks.
* ```Release```: Fully optimized, with fewer runtime checks and no test hooks.
* ```Test```: Optimized, very similar to ```Release``` but with more runtime checks and most test hooks.

### Deployment ###

If you use ChakraCore you will need to deploy ```ChakraCore.dll``` with your application. You may also need to redistribute MSVC runtime libraries because ChakraCore.dll has runtime dependency on MSVC libraries by default. For more information see [Redistributing Visual C++ Files](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms235299.aspx).
* Note if you build with Visual Studio 2015: There are some new requirements due to universal CRT changes. See [Introducing the Universal CRT](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vcblog/archive/2015/03/03/introducing-the-universal-crt.aspx).

Alternatively, you can build ChakraCore without MSVC runtime dependency. Pass an additional parameter to msbuild so that ChakraCore links to MSVC libraries statically:
```
msbuild ... /p:RuntimeLib=static_library ...
```
