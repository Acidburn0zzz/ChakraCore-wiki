### Contributing Code

Before submitting a feature or substantial code contribution please discuss it with the team and ensure it follows the product roadmap. The team rigorously reviews and tests all code submissions. The submissions must meet a high bar for quality, design, and roadmap appropriateness.

ChakraCore is an organically grown codebase. The consistency of style reflects this. For the most part, the team follows these coding conventions. Contributors should also follow them when making submissions. 

For now, the team has set the following limits on pull requests:
* Contributions beyond the level of a bug fix must be discussed with the team first, or they will likely be declined. As our process matures and our experience grows, the team expects to take larger contributions.
* Only contributions against the master branch will be accepted. Authors submitting pull requests that target experimental feature branches or release branches will likely be asked target their pull request at the master branch.
* Pull requests that do not merge easily with the tip of the master branch will be declined. The author will be asked to merge with tip and update the pull request.
* Submissions must meet functional and performance expectations, including scenarios for which the team doesn’t yet have open source tests. This means you may be asked to fix and resubmit your pull request against a new open test case if it fails one of these tests.


These two blogs posts on contributing code to open source projects are a good reference: Open Source Contribution Etiquette by Miguel de Icaza and Don’t “Push” Your Pull Requests by Ilya Grigorik.

You must sign a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) before submitting your pull request. To complete the CLA, submit a request via the form and electronically sign the CLA when you receive the email containing the link to the document. You need to complete the CLA only once.
