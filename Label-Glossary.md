 - Issue related to the Linux cross-platform port.

[**Merged**](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/labels/Merged)

 - The change has been merged in, but for some reason was not automatically closed as merged by GitHub, so we had to close the issue manually.

[**Needs More Info**](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/labels/Needs%20More%20Info)

 - Issue sounds legitimate but needs more information to be actionable.

[**Needs Proposal**](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/labels/Needs%20Proposal)

[**Pending TC39 Consensus**](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/labels/Pending%20TC39%20Consensus)

[**Task**](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/labels/Task)

 - Issue has a clear, actionable task.

**Test** (omitted)

 - We are deliberately omitting this label because issues of this category generally fit into either **Task** or **Bug**. Labeling something as **Test** causes developers to de-prioritize the issues, even if they would otherwise be regarded as important.

[**Won't Fix**](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/labels/Won't%20Fix)

 - Issue will not be fixed.

[**Your first PR**](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/labels/Your%20first%20PR)

 - Issue is well suited to for people new to GitHub contributions -- we're here to help you get started in OSS.  These issues are typically limited in scope and impact and thus are good starting points to become familiar with being a contributor to ChakraCore.
