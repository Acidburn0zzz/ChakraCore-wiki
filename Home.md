There are two primary ways of developing with ChakraCore: as a user and as a contributor.  

## As a user

To embed ChakraCore in your applications, you can read through the [[Embedding ChakraCore]] and the [[JavaScript Runtime (JSRT) reference]] documentation.

## As a contributor

To contribute to ChakraCore, you can read through the [[Architecture Overview]] and the [Contributor Guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/ChakraCore/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).
